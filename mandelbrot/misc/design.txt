Design notes

----
20080824 tiles version

at the "app" level:
- record each view as a database entry
- provide a list view activity to see the history of tiles computed
  (instead of a "hidden undo stack")
- "viewer activity"

Each "screen" is:
- a list of tiles
- typically 3x4 tiles per screen
- "infinite" map: just create new tiles as they become visible
- tiles are computing when they are visible
- each tile is independant, i.e. it has it's own computation-pending state
  and its own bitmap.
- to save space, tiles do not memorize the mandelbrot "values", just the
  rendered bitmap.
- tiles are synced to disk (bitmap+attrib) in /sdcard/mandelbrot/tiles/...
  We don't want to save them in the database => too big and both are
  flash memory so there's little "speed" benefit.
  Cons: doesn't work if sdcard is not available.
